This repository is divided into 3 parts:
1. client - the actual app that lets you draw digits for model to guess them
1. model - model code
1. gather-data - you can ignore this part, it's not really a part of the project; small web app allowing me to gather more data for training. It saves the data to json file which then can be loaded to train the model.
